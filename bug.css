The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if you make a mistake in the calculation, it might not always produce an error message, but rather unexpected results. For example, missing a closing parenthesis or using an unsupported unit can lead to the calculation failing silently. This can be difficult to debug since the browser might not provide much information about what went wrong.
